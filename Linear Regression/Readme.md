MSE Regressor

Here I have implemented a Linear Regressor from scratch with 'variant increment' Sequential Grading Decent Optimizarion. This regressor was also compared with a Trivial Regressor to evaluate its performance.

Learning curves for different Learning rates was obtained and the error on the test set was calculated.

Only standard python libraries, numpy and matplotlib were used for the implementation. Pandas was used to only load the datasets.
